# Representable PA +

Representable is creating maps of communities to fight for equal and impartial representation. The core web app is written in Django with Javascript/HTML/CSS frontend and Postgres/PostGIS backend.

- There is a mapping & visualization app that allows orgs and users to draw their communities of interests. This is written in React & built using `createreactapp` and `Material UI`.
- In development is a dashboard component that allows orgs to define their turfs to do census outreach. This is build in Vue, Flask, and Airflow.
